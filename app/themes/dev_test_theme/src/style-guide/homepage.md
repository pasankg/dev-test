### Overview

The style guide is organised into 5 sections as so:

1. [Base](section-1.html) - Color palettes, base HTML elements, and SASS modules.
2. [Elements](section-2.html) - HTML elements such as form defaults.
3. [Components](section-3.html) - Building blocks that are used to build pages.
4. [Utilities](section-4.html) - Reusuable pieces to help rapidly build out components.
5. [Mockups](section-5.html) - Complete page examples.

### How to use

Use the menu on the left to navigate each section. A sub menu allows you to drill
down and see the components under each section.

Each component has a number.

The search bar lets you look for a specific component name or number.

When viewing a component, the example box shows how that component will looks.
Click the blue arrow next to the component title to see the component by itself. 
This is useful for testing the responsive layout of a component across many device
widths. Some components (such as all mockups) don't have an example box, and the 
only way to preview them is via the blue arrow.
