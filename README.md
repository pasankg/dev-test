# Drupal Project

Use this project as a template for working on Drupal core and contrib modules.

## Requirements

Most of the dev tools are in the php Docker container, but you will need one or two
out side of that.

This includes:

* PHP 7.1+
* Git
* and [Composer][5].

If you don't have these installed, then follow the instructions for your specific
platform.

### MacOS

Download and install Homebrew follow the [online instructions][4].

Add the php tap:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
brew install git composer php71 php71-mcrypt php71-xdebug
```

### Windows

TBC

## Installing

To create a new project in a directory called `myproject' run the following
command.

```bash
composer create-project --no-install -s dev previousnext/drupal-project myproject
```

## Docker

You will need to install Docker and related tools.

### OS-specific Installation

#### MacOS

Download and install [Docker for Mac][1]

#### Windows

Download and install [Docker for Windows][2]

Download and install [Make for Windows][3]

#### Linux

You know what you're doing, right?

## Docker Compose

Due to networking, and file system performance issues in Docker for Mac, you
need a slightly different docker-compose.yml file for MacOS. To simplify your
commands, we recommend creating an alias in `~/.bashrc` such as:

```
alias dc='docker-compose -f docker-compose.osx.yml'
```

To start the container, run:

```bash
dc up -d
```

## Setup and Install Drupal

For simplicity, run all commands from within the php container. You can get
shell access via:

```
dc exec app bash
```

To initialise your local dev environment run the following:

```bash
make init install
```

## Developer Options

To set up common developer options, run:

```bash
make devify
```

## Install a contrib module

The easiest way to install a contrib module to work on is via composer.

For example, to work on pathauto, type the following:

```
composer require drupal/pathauto --prefer-source
```

## Testing

To run tests, run:

```bash
make test
```
